CS-465 Full Stack Development (MEAN)

In our project, we utilized HTML, JavaScript, and Express to focus on the front-end development aspect. Our primary objective was to retrieve data from static HTML files and, using JavaScript alongside Express, transform this data into a dynamic single-page application (SPA).
For our database needs, we employed MongoDB, a versatile cloud-based solution that offers excellent scalability and flexibility. One of the advantages of using MongoDB is its ability to retrieve data in JSON format, making it easy to work with in JavaScript applications.
It's important to note the differences in syntax between JavaScript and JSON. JavaScript syntax is relatively relaxed, allowing for greater flexibility when writing code. In contrast, JSON syntax is stricter; it requires double quotes around field names and values, adhering to a defined structure that ensures data integrity.
In our project, we relied on APIs to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end components, allowing us to seamlessly exchange data. This integration is crucial for creating a cohesive user experience.
To become a well-rounded developer, understanding full-stack development is essential. While back-end development focuses on server-side processes, front-end development emphasizes the user interface and user experience. Familiarity with both sides enables developers to understand the requirements and challenges of each aspect, ultimately leading to greater proficiency in the field.
Throughout this project, my understanding of front-end development has significantly improved. I had the opportunity to learn about the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) and apply that knowledge in practical scenarios. This experience has been both enjoyable and challenging, presenting various obstacles to overcome. I recognize that continuous practice and further exploration of these technologies will be crucial for enhancing the skills I acquired in this course.
